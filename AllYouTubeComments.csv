Konia z rzedem temu, kto tam na poczatku widzi nanoboty zamiast ewolucyjnego czlowieka-kosmite z przyszlosci. A to pustkowie, jalowosc? To zniszczona Ziemia? Tworzenie obiektow o takiej masie mialoby wplyw na otoczenie, grawitacje... Troche szkoda, bo pomysl mieli fajny, wykonanie ladne, ale calosc dosc absurdalna i nie robiaca takiego wrazenia jak powinna, bo wspolczesne kino juz nas przywyczailo do pieknych hologramowych symulacji na ekranie i cyfrowego kosmosu oraz planet. Na tym tle ten uklad sloneczny wypada dosc bladziudko. Nigdzie nie ma slowa o zaangazowaniu Little fingera, ktory po GOT pewnie w piorka porosl. Ale stylizacje ma koszamrna, ta fryzura na cukier i szmaty szydelkowane z serwetki. Czemu zawsze musza tak udziwniac i smietnikowac styl przyszlosci?<br />Jestem zainteresowana newsem, tym wydarzeniem, chociaz malym w skali czasu i osiagniec - to wciaz zabawy mrowek, a nie prawdziwe odkrycia i odpowiedzi na cokolwiek, ale jednak wolalabym to nie udziwnionej przekazowo formie z wykorzystaniem dobrych animacji.",08-11-2015,7:56:38,Top Level

As well as wonderfully engaging cartoon versions of Rosetta and Philae that people have come to love. It&#39;s important to engage the public because science in raw numbers so to speak can be incredibly dry, slow and boring and when you are not part of that particular project or studied that field it is hard to understand the excitement.

Even now they&#39;re becoming watches, lenses, glasses, and are becoming integral parts of our houses, building materials, clothing, etcetera. brain-machine interfacing is a reality already. Did you read about the team of researchers that were able to make one person move another person&#39;s hand through the internet?<br /><br />As far as the materials required to do all the awesome stuff you&#39;ve seen in the video; as far as we know this could just be photons and force fields. 3D projections that make up a simulation and interacts with said interface. But I could even see this working out in the &#39;real physical world&#39;. Look up 4D printing; the process of making materials that can assemble themselves in certain configurations. Look at drones, and at the sizes they can come. IBM prototypes nanoprobes that delivers medicine to specific locations in the body, for example. If teeny tiny machines can coalesce to form bigger structures as seen in this video, why the heck could it not become reality? Just draw the line from here to there. Lots of obstacles, sure, but not at all far-fetched. It&#39;s right in front of you; just look around. ;) ",11-12-2014,14:28:21,Top Level

Shades of the Metatron 49,We don&#39;t have a few years my friend.Mankind does not learn from it&#39;s mistakes but repeats them <br />Plato taught this over 2 thousand years ago and since then not much has changed <br />People today are only smarter and have the tools to modify the earth as pleased but the ape of our preistoric past is still there in our Genes and in our nature only that this time it has the power and strength to destroy the planet and not just onother ape<br />Otherwise the rosetta mission would have been a long forgoten scientific discovery of the year 10.000 b.c and now we would all have been every where in the Universe and have colonized entire Galaxies<br />If it was&#39;nt for our brutal nature we would now be like those two in this short film discussing about the Rosetta mission as something so ancient almost to seem a myth of a long forgoten past<br />Sorry if I seem pessimistic but we are all in trouble science alone won&#39;t kill the ape inside of us and Religion has only Made things worse<br />The world is moving for war not for the esploration of space and this time it will be a big war<br />The reason why I wanted the photo frame of the meteorite exploding in the sky breaking up in four pieces comes from a vision I had around 10 years ago about a Comet impacting with the earth that would split in 4 pieces entering our atmosphere<br />Reason for why ESA if ever reading my huge posts I leave around Youtube would probably never allow someone like me to use there material for a profile picture.And I will respect thier refusal or silence,2/15/2015,1:18:36,Reply

Slotinvids,"I&#39;ve just thought of something, plus a theory with what I&#39;m about to mention, which may sound impossible &amp; unlikely to most people of you out there. But anyway, since Water is the key to life, then plus all the other elements in the universe. The movie short led me to think that us humans &amp; other life forms came from a Ice comet yes? All because of water. And now since there were 2 key things I&#39;ve heard in that movie short, made me think even more. The word &quot;Reset&quot;, &amp; the Rosetta Mission. Now I believe those 2 things were linked to this movie short. The time set for within this movie short, must to have been taken place in the far future, where us humans had wrecked the planet, &amp; not many of us with god like technology (Which must&#39;ve been invented somehow.) were left there to help rebuild &amp; resustain life on this planet again. The Master even said &quot; We fall, &amp; we pick ourselves up again, &amp; we adapt.&quot; Then later on the Master says &quot;Reset!&quot; Yet somehow the apprentice managed to spawn 5 comet fragments as soon as she whispered &quot;Water.&quot;. To &quot;reset&quot; our planet Earth. Now I think that this Rosetta mission may have now just helped us to reserve this comet for an emergency, a sacrifice, a &quot;reset&quot; for our home planet. Because WE failed, &amp; we knew that we had to &quot;restart&quot; this planet all over again without us being there, until we evolved again back into our advanced human form again. Which is maybe why this video was uploaded to the public. Most people just think it&#39;s just a cool looking short, which it is. But most people aren&#39;t getting the hidden message, which could be possible in the future. Also I like how the Master used the word &quot;enchanting&quot;, to use as an adjective, to describe such a comet that could help sustain life on a planet with it just having the right conditions for life.<br /><br />Now for the theory. If this happened before, before the dinosaur ages of life, just think. Why was this planet to be the one? The one that has just the right distance between itself &amp; the Sun to help us sustain life longer, with it&#39;s appropriate conditions for life than Mars did? (Which most of us do believe, life was once on Mars.) Even when after the 2nd space object collided with Earth? Because those Dinosaurs must&#39;ve been extinct for a reason, so that us advanced humans could exist. Now this led me to think",11-03-2014,7:14:57,Top Level

Phil Francis,"Rosetta will show the fact that comets are just made of solid rock and are basically the same as asteroids but on different orbits around the Sun. The reason they form a coma and tail is not because of internal jets bursting through the surface but because they are negatively charged and are arcing as they cross the Sun&#39;s electromagnetic field which is positively charged. It is simply not possible to get any heat through the surface of the rock which is on average -70 degrees and heat the inertia, plus there isn&#39;t enough gravity to hold the coma and tail together if there was only gravity working on them, they would quickly bellow and get lost to space. The reason that they do hold their relatively static shape over many tens of thousands of miles is because of the electromagnetic effect which 1000, billion, billion, billion, billion times more powerful than the &#39;bending of light on a flat bit of cloth&#39;. <a rel=\""nofollow\"" class=\""ot-hashtag\"" href=\""https",10/26/2014,14:18:08,Top Level

And is brought from inside to surface by volcanic activity. Not the result of comets or other icy bodies slamming into them. I was stunned.

Plakaty to juz w ogóle przywoluja mnóstwo wspomnien, Bardzo podoba mi sie muzyka, która u Baginskiego zwykle jest mocnym elementem, wedlug mnie wspaniale wybiera on twórców. Byloby cudownie, gdyby powstaly dluzsze kawalki z tematem &quot;Water&quot;. Co do gry aktorskiej - odpowiada mi, wpasowuje sie w wykreowana rzeczywistosc, nie watpilam w nia ani chwili. Po prostu akceptuje ten film w calosci i przyjmuje go z ogromna wdziecznoscia, bo wszystko swietnie sie zgralo i stworzylo niezwykly swiat. O efektach specjalnych chyba nie musze nic mówic - Platige, i wszystko jasne. Nurtuje mnie uroda aktorki - caly czas mialam wrazenie, ze skads ja kojarze, ale okazalo sie, ze nie widzialam z nia zadnego filmu.<br />Obawy rodzaju wiedzminskiego mnie takze trzymaja, ale wierze, ze skoro Baginski tak dobrze wyczuwa &quot;istote&quot; róznych opowiesci, to nie pozwoli sobie na porazke. Pewnie ma swiadomosc presji, jaka za soba niesie produkcja tego filmu i postara sie jak najlepiej zreallizowac calosc.<br />Zreszta nawet, jesli film bedzie dopracowanym w kazdym calu arcydzielem i tak po premierze znajda sie osoby dosadnie wyrazajace swoje niezadowolenie.

Every screenwriter in the world knows that you can&#39;t make a movie with nothing but exposition. But this giant overpriced turd is nothing BUT exposition! All these characters do is explain things. There&#39;s absolutely nothing going on. This is bad screenwriting 101. How this thing got made is a mystery to me.,11-11-2014,22:45:57,Top Level
